## Initial Problem

There are many past models, with the *g* and *h* coefficients often quoted in multiple places: with different units (G or nT, or stated as G but really nT), or different levels of precision (and occasionally some typos creep in between copies), or were originally in a coordinate system that wasn't right-handed System III (1965), or assumed a different planetary radius (Jovian Radius = R<sub>J</sub>).  Different users making they own codes may get different results from each other depending on which paper they used for their *g* and *h* values, to what precision their $g$ and $h$ values were, and we suspect users may have forgotten to adjust older models for their different R<sub>J</sub>.  The aim here is to have a standard set of efficient codes, that people can just use and cite.  

## Solution

These are Community Codes for Planetary Spherical Harmonic Internal Field codes, in [**MATLAB**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [**IDL**](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/IDL) and [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/).  These are platform independent, and should work on PC, Mac or Linux. These are essentially the same code translated in to the three languages, with our testing so far, the 3 languages give the same results to less than 10<sup>-11</sup> nT (rounding errors).

Just download the particular file you want (language, particular model, and if Cartesian (xyz) or Spherical (rtp)) to your local directory, and run.  No 'install' required and each code is independent.  They can be run with scalar inputs, or with 1D vector inputs.  For MATLAB, the 1D vector must be a column vector not a row vector (while the code could check and transpose, if necessary, that would slow it down.) For Python, you must have NumPy installed and the inputs can be a list or NumPy array.

The comments at the top of each code provide citations to papers where the *g* and *h* coefficients were sourced, and other info.
All inputs are in a **right-handed System III (1965)** frame, with distances in units of R<sub>J</sub>, where **1 R<sub>J</sub> = 71,492 km always**, and angles (for spherical) in units of radians.  All these codes are set up to use degree = order, and for convenience, we simply refer to both degree and order as order.

These codes will take inputs in Cartesian ([*x*,*y*,*z*] in units of R<sub>J</sub>) or Spherical ([*r*, *Co-Lat.*, *East Long.*] in units of R<sub>J</sub> and radians) and return the internal planetary field model values ([*B<sub>x</sub>*, *B<sub>y</sub>*, *B<sub>z</sub>*] or [*B<sub>r</sub>*, *B<sub>theta</sub>*, *B<sub>phi</sub>*] respectively, in units of nT). For older models that used different values of R<sub>J</sub>, our codes below still expect inputs where R<sub>J</sub> = 71,492 km, and will adjust the R<sub>J</sub> for you within the code.

Files can be found under the Planet directory, then language subdirectories.  File names are similar to "*jovian_jrm33_order13_internal_xyz*", where underscores separate out the information, e.g. Planet = Jovian (= Jupiter), model = JRM33, order (= degree) is 13, internal to highlight this is just the internal field (excluding things like magnetic fields due to a current disk), and xyz = Cartesian inputs/outputs (or rtp = Spherical inputs/outputs).

*The directory Mother_Source is not expected to be used by you, but contains the script that writes out all the MATLAB, IDL, Python codes, and is only here for completeness. Ignore it.*

These run quickly, but the higher the order, the longer it takes simply due to more computations required.  The actual speed will depend on your machine, your operating system, and which versions of IDL, MATLAB or Python 3 you have installed.  In a test in 2022, running jrm33 order 13 in MATLAB on a Mac for a vector of ~2 million points took around 5s. 

## Spherical Harmonic Models Included

We recommend using JRM33 order 13, but here is the list of existing models.  All these were developed in a right-handed System III (1965) system (some earlier models had used System III (1957)[^1]), but assumed different values for what 1 R<sub>J</sub> was.
[^1]: The SHA model was originally calculated in the System III (1957) frame, but *Connerney* 2007 converted the *g* and *h* coefficients in to System III (1965), however G<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> is listed as 11,300 nT, but we believe this has a sign typo and should be -11,300 nT.  The R<sub>J</sub> value is not specified, but we believe they used 71,398 km.

| Model | Order | Planet  | Original Model Reference | R<sub>J</sub> used in original work | Reference used for *g* and *h* values | Other references for *g* and *h* values |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |----------------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| JRM33 |   18  | Jupiter | *Connerney et al.*, 2022  | 71,492 km | *Connerney et al.*, 2022 | *Connerney*, 2020[^4] |
| **JRM33** |  **13**   | **Jupiter** | ***Connerney et al., 2022*** | 71,492 km | ***Connerney et al.***, 2022 | *Connerney*, 2020[^4] |
| JRM09 |   10  | Jupiter | *Connerney et al.*, 2018 | 71,492 km | *Connerney et al.*, 2018 | *Connerney*, 2020[^4] |
| ISaAC |   10  | Jupiter | *Hess et al.*, 2017       | 71,492 km | *Hess et al.*, 2017 | |
| VIPAL |    5  | Jupiter | *Hess et al.*, 2011       | 71,492 km | *Hess et al.*, 2011 | |
| VIT4  |    4  | Jupiter | *Connerney et al.*, 1998  | 71,323 km[^2] | *Connerney* 2007 | *Hess et al.*, 2011[^3]  |
| VIP4  |    4  | Jupiter | *Connerney et al.*, 1998  | 71,323 km[^2] | *Connerney* 2007 | *Hess et al.*, 2011 |
| O6    |    3  | Jupiter | *Connerney* 1992          | 71,372 km |*Connerney* 1992 | *Connerney et al.*, 1998 |
[^2]: R<sub>J</sub> = 71,323 km based on table 1 of the original paper, and thus used here.  However the original paper also states a value of 71,398 km earlier in the text, while the 2007 book suggests 71,372 km earlier in the text then doesn't explicitly list an R<sub>J</sub> with the table for VIP4 and VIT4 coefficients (yet does list specific Rs for some other models).  However, Connerney (private communication) says to use the earliest publication, hence table 1 of original paper.
[^3]: h<sub>4</sub><sup>4</sup> has a typo, probably should be 0.1264 G.
[^4]: The PDS archive is cited as year 2020 here, but was originally from 2017.  The models were added to this dataset in later years, but same doi for the whole dataset, hene the year may be later than that of the original papers.
The reference papers may provide *g* and *h* values to higher orders, but the authors do not always trust those higher order values (see their papers). Hence the order used here may be lower than given what you can find in publications.  In the case of JRM33, the authors used both order 13 and order 18 for plots in their paper, so we provide code for both, but we recommend using JRM order 13 for your studies (*personal communication with authors*).

## Examples

For all 3 languages, the output's 1<sup>st</sup> dimension is always number of records (=1 if scalar) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> dimension is always size 3 for the B-vector components, but some languages are row-major, other column-major. This is best seen in the example outputs below that all give the same inputs in each test, but the outputs may be transposed from each other.

The following examples (same situation for each language) all use *jovian_jrm33_order13_internal_rtp* and *jovian_jrm33_order13_internal_xyz*, but these can be simply swapped with any of the other model files in this collection, they all have the same input and output formats.

## Solution #2: JupiterMag

There is sister community code that will do the same models here, and give the same results, over at [https://github.com/mattkjames7/JupiterMag](https://github.com/mattkjames7/JupiterMag).  This is a Python 3 package that requires a simple install, and has more flexibility than this code, e.g. you could have Cartesian inputs, but outputs in Spherical.  It also includes code for a current sheet, and field line tracing.

We have tested the JupiterMag codes against the codes here, and for same inputs we still get the same outputs to within the same rounding errors.

## Speed Tests

The following speed tests were done on a Mac in 2022, but speed depends on your physical computer, your operating system, what else you're running and even which version of IDL or Matlab you have.  e.g. IDL 8.4 took 17s to run our code in a test, but the same test on IDL 8.8 took 14s.
For below we test both the spherical (RTP) codes and Cartesian (xyz), when running 75641 test positions once as a vector, or as 75641 scalars in a FOR loop.  We show comparisons of the 3 language codes in this repository, and also the sister [*JupiterMag* code](README.md#solution-2-jupitermag).
